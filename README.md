#### `chatbot: response`

        Creating an online job portal/application 
        similar to Indeed or JobStreet is an ambitious 
        project. Here's an outline of the key features 
        and components you can consider implementing 
        using Django:

## 📌 *User Authentication and Profiles:*

- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality for both job seekers and employers.
- [ ] Allow job seekers to create and manage their profiles with information such as education, professional qualifications, skills, work experience, etc.
- [ ] Enable employers to create and manage their company profiles with details like company name, location, industry, and description.

## 📌 *Job Listings:*

- [ ] Allow employers to post job listings with information such as job title, description, requirements, location, salary range, and application deadline.
- [ ] Implement a search and filter functionality for job seekers to find relevant job listings based on criteria like keywords, location, industry, etc.
- [ ] Display job listings with pagination and sorting options for ease of navigation.

## 📌 *Application Process:*

- [ ] Send email notifications to employers when a job seeker applies for their posted job.
- [ ] Enable employers to view and manage the applications they receive, including shortlisting and contacting applicants.

## 📌 *Job Alerts and Notifications:*

- [ ] Send email notifications to job seekers about new job opportunities and updates related to their applications.

## 📌 *User Interaction and Communication:*

- [ ] Allow employers and job seekers to communicate within the platform, such as through a messaging system or direct contact details (email, phone) shared by the employer.
- [ ] Enable employers to save and manage their favorite job seeker profiles for future reference.

## 📌 *Admin Panel:*

- [ ] Create an admin panel for the site administrator to manage user accounts, job listings, and other relevant data.
- [ ] Implement moderation features to review and approve job listings before they are published on the platform.

## 📌 *Responsive Design and User Experience:*

- [ ] Ensure the application is responsive and optimized for various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) to provide a seamless user experience.
- [ ] Remember to : 
  - [ ] thoroughly plan and design the database schema, considering the relationships between entities such as users, job listings, and applications. 
  - [ ] Additionally, prioritize security measures to protect user data and implement features like CSRF protection and user permissions.
